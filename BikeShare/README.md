# BikeShare

This project analyzes data from bike-sharing systems in Chicago, Washington and NYC. For displaying purposes, I have not used Pandas. Python dictionary has been used to store and manipulate data, and graphs have been made using **matplotlib**

I have provided two files: a Jupyter Notebook file and an HTML file. Both contain the same data and can be seen by accessing these links
