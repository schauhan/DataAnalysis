# GapMinder Dataset

This is a project I worked on for evaluation purposes. I have chosen 3 independent datasets from the website GapMinder World (https://www.gapminder.org/data/) and have attempted to analyze them, trying to see if there is any correlation between the datasets.

I have performed the analysis using the regular 3-step process.
1. **Cleaning** the data downloaded and removing any bad data
2. **Reshaping** data by comparing the datasets that need to be compared and removing the data points that cannot be compared. For example missign data for countries or dates in the two datasets inder investigation.
3. **Visualizing** the cleaned data using Pandas, matplotlib, numpy and other tools in the Python domain.
